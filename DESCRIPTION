Description: CNpare is designed to compare and contrast genome-wide tumour copy 
    number profiles. This package can be used to: 1) calculate similarities 
    between copy-number profiles, 2) quantify the extent of genome differences 
    between copy-number profiles, and 3) compare profiles based on copy-number 
    signatures. The most basic initial input to the CNpare package consists of 
    a data frame containing the segmented copy number profile from a tumor 
    sample, which can be compared to the cells_segcn.RData included in this
    package in order to find the most representative model system.
